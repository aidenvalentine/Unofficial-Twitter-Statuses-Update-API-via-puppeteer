# Unofficial-Twitter-Statuses-Update-API-via-puppeteer
 Bypass the X.com statuses/update API with this puppeteer script.

All you need to do is change the auth_token inside ```index.js``` to a cookie from a Logged In session in your browser. Use the developer tools if you need help.

This script is for plain text statuses ONLY.
